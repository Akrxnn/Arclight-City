## What is Inventory?
Every adventurer has their own inventory, which can be used to store items and loot. Items stored in the inventory will not be lost when you die in strongholds.

## How do I increase inventory size?
You can increase the number of slots in your inventory by following these methods:

- Renting an apartment; higher-tier apartments come with a greater number of slots.
- Upgrading your inventory by clicking the `+` button located next to the slot counter.
## What is a Backpack?
The backpack is what you carry with you into strongholds. You can only access items stored in your backpack while exploring strongholds. However, please be aware that if you die within a stronghold, the items in your backpack will be transferred to the Ripperdoc as a deposit to cover your medical expenses. You have the option to repurchase these items from the clinic if you so choose.
