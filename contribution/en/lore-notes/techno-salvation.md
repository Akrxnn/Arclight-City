> You were exploring an abandoned building, looking for anything useful when you stumbled upon a small room filled with dim light. On the walls were painted various graffitis depicting scenes from daily life in Arclight City. One caught your eye particularly:

> A large pachinko ball dominated the center of the painting, surrounded by smaller balls falling towards it. Below it read: "Pachinko is Life". Another image showed a man holding a gun while another held a cross, both pointing at each other. Beneath it was scribbled: "God vs Man". Yet another showed two figures, one human and one robotic, shaking hands beneath a sign reading "Singularity Now!"
