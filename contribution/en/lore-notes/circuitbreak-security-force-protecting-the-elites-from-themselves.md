Are you tired of seeing innocent lives being taken by these so-called "mercenaries"? Are you fed up with hearing about how they rob banks and steal from the rich? Well, we have news for you...

They're lying! These criminals are nothing more than pawns in a bigger scheme orchestrated by the corrupt CircuitBreak Security Force. They claim to protect our beloved Arclight City from harm, but in reality, they're just protecting their own interestsâ€”the interests of the wealthy elites who control everything around us.

Don't fall for their lies anymore! It's time to expose the truth behind the shadows and take back our city from those who seek to oppress us. Join us today and help us fight against tyranny!
