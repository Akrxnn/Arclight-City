> You were walking through the abandoned warehouse, looking for anything useful when you stumbled upon an old terminal on the wall. Curiosity got the best of you and decided to have a look. As soon as you turned it on, a message appeared on the screen:
> *My Dearest One*,
>
> I don't know if this letter will ever reach you, but I had to try. Every day without hearing from you feels like an eternity, and my heart aches knowing that we may never see each other again. Our love was forbidden, our relationship taboo, yet it felt so right. We shared moments of passion and tenderness that I will cherish forever.
>
> The memories haunt me, taunting me with what could have been. But despite everything, I still hold onto hope. Maybe someday we'll find each other again, amidst the chaos of this cruel world. Until then, please remember that you are always in my thoughts and prayers.
>
> Yours truly,
>
> **Maxine**
