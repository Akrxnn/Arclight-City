Lilith's Store, owned by Lillian Liu, has been operating within the city limits since 2079. It started as a small shop dealing with various types of cyberware, but quickly grew due to its unique approach towards customer service and product quality. However, our investigation revealed that beneath the surface, Lilith's Store had been involved in illegal weapon deals.

Officer John Smith conducted surveillance operations which led him to discover that Lillian Liu was using her store as a front for smuggling weapons from the black market. These weapons were then sold to unsuspecting clients, including members of rival gangs and even some individuals connected to the Mega Corporation CircuitBreak.

On December 24, 2083, a search warrant was executed at Lilith's Store, resulting in the confiscation of several illegal firearms, explosives, and ammunition. Lillian Liu was arrested during the operation and charged with multiple counts of illegal weapon dealing. She remains in custody awaiting trial, with a bail amount set at €100,000.

This case serves as a warning to anyone considering engaging in illicit activities within the city limits. The ACPD will continue to crack down on criminals and bring them to justice, regardless of their status or connections.
