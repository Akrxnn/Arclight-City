*Inside a dimly lit room, scattered with debris and broken furniture.*

To whoever finds this,

My name is Wei Chang, CEO of TaiXing Cybernetic. We are developing a revolutionary new technology that could change the course of history. Our research facility was attacked by rival corporations trying to steal our secrets. Many lives were lost, including mine.

But before I die, I must ensure that our work doesn't fall into the wrong hands. Destroy everything you find here. Burn the blueprints, smash the hardware, and wipe away every trace of our progress. Only then can we prevent another tragedy like this from happening again.

May the memory of those who died today serve as a reminder of the cost of progress. And let us never forget the importance of keeping our discoveries safe from those who would abuse them.

Signed,

Wei Chang

CEO, TaiXing Cybernetic
