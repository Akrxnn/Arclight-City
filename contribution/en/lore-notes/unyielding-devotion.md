> Dearest Chloe,
> I miss you so much my heart aches every day since we were forced apart. The streets aren't the same without your smile lighting up my path. Everywhere I turn, all I can see is our memories dancing before me—our laughter echoing off abandoned buildings, the warmth of your touch still lingering on worn surfaces... But alas, fate seems determined to keep us apart.
>
> As I write this letter, bullets whiz past my head and danger lurks around every corner. It feels as though the universe itself conspires against us. Yet despite everything stacked against us, I hold onto hope—a tiny flame flickering inside me that refuses to die out. Because even amidst chaos and despair, true love finds a way.
>
> Until we meet again (and oh! How I long for that moment), please take care of yourself, my dearest Chloe. Know that each breath I take is for us, and that someday soon, we shall embrace once more beneath the neon lights of Arclight City.
>
> Yours forevermore,
>
> Jack
