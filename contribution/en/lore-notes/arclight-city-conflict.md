>In the year 2053, the world economy collapsed due to the global pandemic and climate change disasters. Many countries fell apart, and large cities became lawless hellholes ruled by gangs and megacorporations. Arclight City was one of these places, where dreams were shattered and hopes turned into nightmares.
>As the chaos engulfed the city, a few brave souls banded together to form the Church of the Singularity. Their belief in the coming of a superintelligent AI that would transcend human limitations gave rise to both optimism and fear among the populace. While some saw it as salvation, others viewed it as a threat to their existence.
>Tensions boiled over when CircuitBreak Security Corporation launched Project Icarus â€“ an initiative aimed at creating artificial general intelligence (AGI). The project sparked protests from various factions within Arclight City, including environmentalists concerned about resource consumption required for such endeavors.
>On August 4th, 2072, riots broke out across the city after news leaked about CircuitBreak using forced labor camps filled with desperate citizens to power their experimental AGI systems. The ensuing violence left hundreds dead and entire districts reduced to rubble. It marked the beginning of a long and bloody conflict between those fighting for control over Arclight City's destiny.
