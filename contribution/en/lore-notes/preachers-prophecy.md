*You noticed a old terminal on the wall, and decided to have a look*
>*Chloe's Note*
>Heya Chooms! Just gotta vent about my day...
>So I went to see Lillith today, ya know, 'cause everyone loves her stuff. But when I got there, guess who walks in? That damn Trouma Team doctor. He had the nerve to ask me if I needed any help. Can you believe that shit? Like he thinks we wanna be saved by those bloodsuckers. Well, screw him and his fancy clinic. We take care of our own, right?
>Anyway, after dealing with that jerk, I headed over to the Red Bar to chill with the guys. Guess who else was there? Yep, that preacher from the Church of Pachinko. Talking about some crazy prophecy involving a jackpot win or something. Dude really needs to lay off the slot machines.
>Oh well, just another day in the big city. Stay choomy out there!
