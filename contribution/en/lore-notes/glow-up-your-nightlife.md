>*Chloe's Eyes*: *Looking straight ahead without blinking.*

Hey chooms! Are you tired of looking like a normal joe? Wanna stand out from the crowd? Then come visit me at The Red Bar! I got just the thing for ya.

Introducing... **Glowing Contact Lenses** ! With these bad boys, every time you step into the light, everyone will know who's in charge. Plus, they make great conversation starters. Trust me, the ladies can't resist a pair of sparkly eyes.

So why wait? Come see me tonight and let's give your face a makeover it deserves. Remember, when life gives you lemons, add neon lights and watch the party start!

Cheers,
Chloe
Bartender at The Red Bar
