>*Maxine's Weapon Smith Store Diary Entry*
>Today I saw him again... That mysterious man who walks around town with his big bodyguard. He never talks much, just nods when he sees me working on something new in my shop. But every time our eyes meet, I feel something stirring inside me. Maybe it's fear or excitement â€“ hard to tell with these cyborg enhancements!
>Anyway, today he came alone. Something about the way he carried himself made me realize that maybe he wasn't so tough after all. As he approached my counter, I couldn't help but notice the weariness in his steps and the sadness etched onto his face. For once, he didn't seem invincible.
>We exchanged pleasantries (well, as pleasant as they could be in this hellhole). Then without warning, he pulled out a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket and placed it on the counter before leaving abruptly. My curiosity got the best of me, so naturally, I unfolded the note. It read:
>"To the woman who fixes broken things, thank you for being there when no one else would listen. You may not know it yet, but you mean more to me than you ever imagined."
>Signed with nothing but a simple 'C'.
>Well, color me surprised! Turns out even the toughest mercs have soft spots too. Guess I should stop underestimating people based on appearances alone... Who knows? Maybe there's still hope for this damned city after all.
