>*Interviewer:* Tell me about yourself.
>*Subject:* My name is... *[Redacted]*. I am a former member of the Arclight Syndicate, one of the biggest gangs in town. But after my last job went south, I had to leave everything behind and start fresh somewhere else. That's why I ended up here, trying to survive day by day.
>*Interviewer:* And what happened during that last job?
>*Subject:* We were supposed to steal some data from CircuitBreak Security Systems, but we got caught red-handed. They offered us a choice: join them or die. So we joined them, thinking it would be easier than fighting against them every day. But things didn't turn out as planned...
>*Interviewer:* How so?
>*Subject:* Well, let's just say our new employers weren't exactly honest about their intentions either. After gathering enough information about our former gang members, they started eliminating them one by one. It became clear that we were nothing but pawns in their bigger plans.
>*Interviewer:* And now you're here, trying to escape your past. Any regrets?
>*Subject:* Regrets? Of course! Joining the Syndicate wasn't my smartest decision ever made. But looking back, it taught me a lot about loyalty and betrayal â€“ lessons that shaped who I am today. Now I'm just focused on moving forward and staying alive.
