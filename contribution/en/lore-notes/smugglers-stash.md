> You stumbled upon an old terminal hidden behind a stack of crates in the abandoned warehouse. As you approached it, you could see that someone had left a message scrawled across the screen. It read:
> *Smuggler's Inventory Lists*
>
> - Neuroblockers (High Grade)
> - Weapon Parts (Assorted)
> - Counterfeit Euros (Large Quantity)
> - Illegal Cyberware Modules (Low Grade)
>
> The list seemed incomplete, but it was still useful information. From the looks of it, this smuggler dealt mainly in contraband items and low-level cyberware mods. Their operation must have been small-time compared to some of the bigger players in town. Still, knowing about these connections could prove helpful when looking for new jobs or trying to expand your own operations.
