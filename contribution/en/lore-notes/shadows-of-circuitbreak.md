>*Chloe looked at me from behind the counter, her expression blank.*
>She cleared her throat before speaking. "So... You're looking for information about Lilith?"
>I leaned my elbows on the countertop, trying to appear casual. "Yeah, just wondering if anyone had seen her around lately."
>Chloe shook her head slowly. "Haven't heard anything about her since..." She paused, glancing towards the door before continuing softly. "Since she got mixed up with that job for CircuitBreak."
>My heart skipped a beat at the mention of the infamous security firm. I knew Lilith wasn't afraid of getting her hands dirty, but working for CircuitBreak meant taking on jobs that were beyond risky.
>I forced myself to stay calm. "What kind of job?"
>Chloe took another quick glance around us before answering quietly. "Supposedly, it was something big â€“ involving one of their top clients. Word on the street is that things didn't go according to plan and now everyone involved is missing."
>An uneasy feeling settled in my stomach as I realized what this could mean for Lilith. If she was still alive, she would be hiding deep within the underbelly of Arclight City until everything blew over. And if she wasn't... well, then maybe it was best not to dwell on that thought.
>With a nod of thanks, I stood up and walked away from the bar, leaving Chloe watching warily from behind the counter. As soon as I was out of sight, I pulled out my phone and dialed a familiar number. It rang twice before being picked up.
>"Maxine," I said without pretense. "It's time we talked about our mutual friend."
>`~`
