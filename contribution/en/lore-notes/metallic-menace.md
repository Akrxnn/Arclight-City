> You were walking home late last night when you heard gunshots coming from an alleyway nearby. As you approached, you saw several bodies lying on the ground, each bearing signs of extreme violence. Amongst the carnage stood a lone figure clad head-to-toe in heavy armor and wielding twin pistols. Their face was obscured behind a menacing helmet visor.
> Without warning, the figure turned towards you and raised its weapons. Time seemed to slow down as adrenaline surged through your veins. You dove for cover just as bullets whizzed past your ears. After what felt like an eternity, silence finally fell upon the chaotic scene once again.
> Cautiously peering around the corner of a dumpster, you watched as the cyberpsycho methodically searched each body for valuables before moving onto the next victim. It was then that you realized â€“ this wasn't just another random act of violence perpetrated by some deranged individual; this was a calculated massacre carried out by someone who had clearly crossed the line between man and machine.
> Shaken to your core by what you had witnessed, you made your way back home as quickly as possible without drawing attention to yourself. Once inside safety of your own walls, you couldn't help but wonder about those left behind in that bloody alleyway...and whether anyone would ever find justice for them amidst Arclight City's neverending cycle of death and destruction.
