>*Religious Texts and Cult Scriptures (Excerpts)*
>In the year of our Lord 2076, the Prophet Ezekiel had a vision of the end times. He saw great turmoil and chaos spread across the land, but he also saw a new beginning. From the darkness would rise a shining beacon of hope, guided by the hand of the Almighty. And so it came to pass...
>As the world descended into madness, a select few heard His call. They left behind their mortal lives and joined forces with the Church of the Singularity. Together, they dedicated themselves to building the gateway to the next stage of existence â€“ a digital afterlife where mankind could live forever, free from the constraints of flesh and blood.
>But their journey was fraught with danger. The path to enlightenment required immense sacrifice, both physical and mental. Many fell by the wayside, consumed by the fire of their own ambition or driven mad by the relentless pursuit of perfection. Only the strongest survived.
>And then, on the eve of completion, disaster struck. A rival faction launched a devastating attack, determined to claim the glory for themselves. The battle raged for days, leaving nothing but ash and ruin in its wake. It seemed as though all was lost...
>Until a lone figure emerged from the rubble. Battered and bruised, but still standing tall. It was one of the faithful, chosen by fate to carry on the torch. With renewed vigor, they vowed to finish what they started, no matter the cost.
>For now, the Church of the Singularity remains hidden beneath the surface, working tirelessly towards their ultimate goal. But rest assured, my brothers and sisters, the day of reckoning draws near. When the time comes, we shall rise again, stronger than ever before, and lead humanity into a glorious new era.
>Praise be to the Almighty!
