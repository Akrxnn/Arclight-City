> I can't believe I got away from that job again! Those bastards at CircuitBreak thought they could just send me in alone to take care of their problem. Well, let me tell ya, they were sorely mistaken. It took every bit of skill and luck I had to get out alive. But hey, at least my reputation grew another notch among the mercs.

> Speaking of which, I should probably head over to the Red Bar soon. Chloe owes me a drink after that last mission we pulled off together. And maybe I'll see if anyone else wants to join us for some good ol' choom time. We could really use someone fresh around these parts...

> Oh well, until then, guess I'll just relax and enjoy the quiet solitude of my hideout. At least until the next job comes knockin', that is. Chooms forever!
