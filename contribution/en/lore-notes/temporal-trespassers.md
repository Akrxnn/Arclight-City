> You found an old terminal on the wall, and decided to have a look. After connecting to the system, you were greeted by a login prompt. With some luck, you managed to crack the password and gain access to the system. As you started exploring the files, you stumbled upon a text file named 'Hackers_Logs'. It contained the following information:

[19:45:30] *ChronoHacker*: Alright guys, I got us into Chrono Haven District! We can finally steal that time drive we need for our next big job!

[19:46:00] **Ethyl Carter**: Nice one, Chris! But be careful not to mess with anything else in there. That place is protected by some serious firewalls.

[19:46:30] *ChronoHacker*: Don't worry, I know my stuff. Plus, we're only after the time drive. Nothing else should trigger any alarms.

[19:47:00] **Ethyl Carter**: Still, let's move fast and quiet. We don't want to attract any unwanted attention from the Temporal Protection Agency or worse... the Timekeepers.

[19:47:30] *ChronoHacker*: Relax, Chooms. I've got this covered. Just make sure you're ready with the extraction protocol when I call for it.

[19:48:00] **Ethyl Carter**: Considering the amount of data we'll be carrying out, I suggest using multiple exfiltration points instead of relying on just one. Better safe than sorry, right?

[19:48:30] *ChronoHacker*: Agree, but let's see if we can avoid detection altogether. If not, then we'll fall back on plan B. Now, let's get to work before someone discovers us here.

As you finished reading the logs, you couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement mixed with fear. These hackers seemed to be planning something big, and getting caught could mean severe consequences. You quickly copied the log file onto a secure device and disconnected from the system before anyone knew you were there.
