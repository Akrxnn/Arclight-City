Today I had my first encounter with our clients... *shudders*. These people are beyond rich and seemingly above the law. They order hits on anyone they want without batting an eye. It makes me sick just thinking about it. But hey, gotta pay those bills somehow right? At least I can take comfort knowing that my job helps keep the streets safe from these monsters. Or so I tell myself every day when I come into work...
