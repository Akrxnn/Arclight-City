> You were exploring the abandoned warehouse when suddenly, you heard gunshots echoing through the hallways. Your heart raced as you realized something terrible had happened. As you carefully made your way towards the source of the noise, you stumbled upon a gruesome sight – bodies strewn across the floor, blood splattered everywhere. Amongst the carnage, you spotted a lone figure standing tall amidst the chaos – a woman clad head-to-toe in heavy armor, her face hidden behind a menacing helmet. She turned around slowly, revealing her identity as none other than Lilith herself!
> With tears streaming down her face, she explained that her beloved store had been targeted by a band of rogue cyberpsychos led by someone calling himself 'Maxwell'. They had come looking for information about a mysterious item known only as 'The Key', which apparently held immense power over both flesh and steel alike. In the ensuing battle, many innocents lost their lives including several members of Lilith's staff. However, thanks to Lilith's quick thinking and combat prowess, she managed to fend off the attackers long enough for help to arrive.
> Shaken but alive, Lilith expressed gratitude towards whomever had found her among these ruins. She promised revenge against those responsible for this tragedy while vowing never again would anyone harm those under her protection. Her words rang true as she disappeared into the night, leaving nothing but silence and despair in her wake...
