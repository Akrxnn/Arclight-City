As I sit here typing this message, my heart races with fear. It feels like someone is watching me, but when I turn around, nobody's there. This job isn't worth losing my sanity over...or worse.

My name is Alex, and I am an employee at **Truama Team**. Yes, we provide top-notch medical care to the rich and influential, but at what cost? Our patients are never just 'patients'; they are potential targets for assassination attempts orchestrated by rival companies trying to gain leverage in the cutthroat world of Arclight City business.

Just last week, we had a patient come in with multiple gunshot wounds after being ambushed outside our clinic. He survived thanks to our team's quick thinking and expertise, but it was clear something wasn't right. As soon as he regained consciousness, he started muttering about seeing strange men lurking near his home and office.

Needless to say, these incidents take a toll on us employees both mentally and emotionally. But what can we do? Speaking up would mean risking our jobs—and possibly our lives—if we were somehow connected to the target. And going along with the charade means living with the knowledge that we may have played a role in someone's death.

This whole situation makes me sick to my stomach. How far will we let ourselves sink before finally standing up against this corruption? Or will we continue down this path until there's nothing left of us but broken shells?

Signed,
Alex
