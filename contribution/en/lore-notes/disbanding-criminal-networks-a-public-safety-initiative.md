>*Subject: Public Policy Regarding Security Measures Against Organized Crime Groups*

As per our recent analysis, organized crime groups continue to pose significant threats to public safety within Arclight City. To address these concerns, we propose implementing stricter security measures across various districts. Our primary objective is to dismantle these criminal networks and restore order while minimizing civilian casualties.

To achieve this aim, we recommend increasing patrols by law enforcement officers equipped with advanced technologies such as drone surveillance and facial recognition software. Additionally, we suggest establishing task forces comprising representatives from different departments (including intelligence units) to coordinate efforts against specific targets.

Furthermore, we urge citizens to report suspicious activities immediately using dedicated hotlines or online portals. We assure them that their identities will remain anonymous unless necessary for investigative purposes.

In conclusion, combatting organized crime requires collective effort involving both authorities and civilians alike. By working together towards a safer future for everyone residing in Arclight City, we can hopefully reduce the prevalence of these harmful groups significantly.
