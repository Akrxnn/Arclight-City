> You were going through the personal belongings of a dead gang member when you stumbled upon an old, worn-out journal. Flipping through its pages, you find a few entries addressed to someone named "Chloe". It seems like the author had quite the crush on her. Here's one of the letters:

> Dear Chloe,
>
> I don't know why I'm doing this... maybe it'll never reach you anyway. But I just can't keep my feelings inside anymore. Every time I see you behind that counter, pouring drinks for those roughnecks, a part of me dies.
>
> You may not remember me, we met once at the Red Bar. I was the guy sitting alone in the corner, nursing my whiskey sour while everyone else around me laughed and talked about their latest jobs. We exchanged a few words, and then you disappeared into the crowd.
>
> Since then, I haven't been able to forget you. Your smile haunts my dreams, your laugh echoes in my memories. And every time I close my eyes, I see you standing behind that bar, serving drinks to strangers who don't appreciate you half as much as they should.
>
> So here I am, writing this letter to let you know how much I care. How much I admire you, and respect you, and desire you. Maybe someday we could meet again, outside these walls of violence and despair. Maybe we could share a drink, and talk about our lives, and find something beautiful amidst all this ugliness.
>
> Until then, take care of yourself, Chloe. Know that there's someone out there who sees beyond the tough exterior, and loves you just the way you are.
>
> Yours truly,
>
> Max
