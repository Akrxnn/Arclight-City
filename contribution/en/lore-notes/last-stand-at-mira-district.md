Time: 16:47
Location: Mira District

Ace Davis: *heavy breathing* Alright boys, let's move! We gotta clear these streets before nightfall. Those damn cyberpsychos won't stop until we take 'em down.

*Sound of gunfire intensifies*

Ace Davis: Oh shit! Watch yourself, Johnny! That son of a bitch just went ballistic!

*Pause*

Ace Davis: This is worse than I thought... We need backup, quick! Anyone still got contact with HQ?

*More gunshots fired*

Unknown Voice: Affirmative, Ace. Hold tight, reinforcements are on their way. But keep moving, don't stay in one spot for too long.

Ace Davis: Roger that. Let's finish this mission and head home safe. For the love of Eddie, let's end this hellhole once and for all.

*Footsteps getting louder*

Ace Davis: Come on, choombas! Show those cyberpsychos why we're the best in the biz!
