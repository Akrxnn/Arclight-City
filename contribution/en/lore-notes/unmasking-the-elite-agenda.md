>*Description:* A crudely made poster plastered onto a dilapidated wall in an alleyway near the heart of Arclight City. It features a sinister image of two shadowy figures standing behind a desk adorned with symbols representing various megacorporations. One figure holds a globe while the other appears to be injecting something into its arm.*
