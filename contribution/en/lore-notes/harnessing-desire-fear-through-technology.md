*You noticed a old terminal on the wall, and decided to have a look*
>Inside the terminal, you find a message left behind by someone named Dr. Katherine Cheng. She seems to be working on creating a new type of neural interface that can enhance memory retention without causing permanent damage to the user's brain. However, during her tests, she encountered an unexpected side effect – subjects were experiencing vivid hallucinations related to their deepest desires and fears.*
>Dr. Cheng became increasingly concerned about the safety of her project and began considering abandoning it altogether. But then she had an idea... She started exploring ways to harness these powerful hallucinations for therapeutic purposes. Perhaps they could help patients overcome phobias or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
>As she continued her research, Dr. Cheng grew more optimistic about the potential benefits of her discovery. But she knew that sharing it with others would come with great risk – both personally and professionally. So she decided to keep her findings hidden away in this abandoned lab until further notice...
