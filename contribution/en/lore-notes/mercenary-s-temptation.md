> I can't believe I got myself into this mess... Again! But hey, money talks right? And boy does it speak loudly when it comes from CircuitBreak. That job offer was just too good to pass up. Plus, let's face it â€“ my skills are top-notch and I knew I could handle anything thrown my way.

But damn, these guys really know how to set up shop in a secure area. Their hideout looks more like a luxury penthouse than a den for criminals. It almost makes me want to join their ranks... Almost.

Anyway, point is, mission accomplished (for now). Time to collect my payment and disappear before anyone gets wise about our little arrangement. Maybe then I can finally take some time off and enjoy the fruits of my labor without having to worry about getting caught up in another sticky situation.

Oh well, such is life as a mercenary in Arclight City. At least the thrill never dies, right? Right... *Chooms glass of whiskey thoughtfully.*
