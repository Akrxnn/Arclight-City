>*Chloe's Note*
>Hey Choombas!
>Just wanna say thanks for coming by the Red Bar tonight. It's been pretty slow lately since we got word about that psycho going around killing folks near the Slums. But hey, looks like business is picking up again now that everyone's scared shitless.
>Anyway, I heard from Lilith that she managed to score some new good stuff from Oriana. Can't wait to see what kinda cyberwear she'll be putting up in her shop next week. Maybe I should stop by and check it out myself... Hmmm...
>Oh well, just another day in the big bad city. Stay safe out there, chooms! And remember: Always tip your bartender! *winks emojily*"
