To whomever finds this message,

I am Lilith, owner of Lilth's Store, the finest purveyor of cyberware in Arclight City. You may recognize my face from the ads plastered around town, or perhaps you've been lucky enough to visit my shop. If so, then you know I don't play games.

Now, I understand that sometimes desperate times call for desperate measures. And while I would never condone stealing, I can appreciate the value of a good bargain. So, let me propose a solution to our current predicament.

Return the stolen goods within 72 hours, and we'll consider this whole incident closed. However, should you choose to ignore my generous offer, well...let's just say that I have connections in certain circles. My reputation alone could ruin yours faster than a virus-infested pachinko machine.

So, take a moment to consider your options carefully. Your future depends on it.

Yours sincerely,
Lilith
