Today was another long day in this hellhole of a city. I woke up early, got my usual fix from Lilith's store before heading out to meet my crew at the Red Bar. We had a job lined up tonight—a simple extraction mission for CircuitBreak Security Corporation. Nothing too complicated or dangerous...at least that's what we thought until we arrived at the target location.

Turns out our employers set us up; ambushed by rival gang members waiting outside the building. Bullets flew everywhere while we tried desperately to extract ourselves from the mess. Luckily, thanks to quick thinking and well-placed shots from Maxine's custom rifle, we managed to fight our way out alive (mostly).

Now lying low somewhere else within the city limits trying not attract unwanted attention after such a botched operation. It feels like every step we take leads deeper into danger instead of closer towards safety. Maybe it's time for me consider finding something safer than being stuck in this neverending cycle of violence and betrayal...but then again maybe not since this is all I know now.

Tomorrow brings another day filled with uncertainty and potential peril – just another typical day living life as a mercenary in Arclight City.
