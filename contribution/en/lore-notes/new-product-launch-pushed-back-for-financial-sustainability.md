Subject: Urgent Notice Regarding New Product Launch
Date: March 15, 2022

Greetings everyone!

As we approach the launch of our latest product line, I would like to take this opportunity to express my concerns about its potential impact on our bottom line. After careful analysis, I believe that the pricing strategy proposed by the sales team may not be sustainable in the long run.

Furthermore, while the design team has done an excellent job creating visually appealing prototypes, I am concerned about the feasibility of mass production within the given timeline. We cannot compromise on quality just to meet deadlines.

Therefore, I propose that we reevaluate both the pricing model and manufacturing process before proceeding further. Let us ensure that we maintain our competitive advantage in the market without sacrificing profitability or customer satisfaction.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please respond with your thoughts and suggestions at your earliest convenience.

Best regards,
Maxine Smith
