> You are walking through the destroyed remains of an enemy gang stronghold when you notice a old terminal on the wall, partially hidden behind debris. As you clear away the rubble, you see that it still functions despite its age. Upon accessing the system, you find a file labeled 'Operation Clean Sweep'. Curiosity gets the best of you and decide to take a peek inside.

Well, today was another day at the office... I mean, the Red Bar. Business hasn't been great since news about Operation Clean Sweep spread around town. Everyone knows someone who got caught up in it—or worse, disappeared completely. It's getting harder to ignore the elephant in the room every time I pour another drink.

But hey, at least we're still open! And let me tell ya, these mercs sure can party hard after a long day of shooting stuff up. Speaking of which, looks like our regular crew just walked in. Time to mix some more potent cocktails and listen to their war stories. Maybe tonight will be different... maybe they'll finally give me something juicy worth writing about.

Until then, stay safe out there folks. And remember: always watch your back—you never know who might be watching.

Cheers!
