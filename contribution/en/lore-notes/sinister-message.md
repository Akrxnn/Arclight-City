> You notice a crumpled piece of paper lying on the ground near a dead body. As you approach, you see that it's a handwritten note addressed to someone named "Chloe". It reads:
> *My dearest Chloe,*
> *I hope this message finds its way to you safely.*
> *As we agreed upon, I am sending this letter to remind you about our arrangement. Remember, silence is golden, especially when it concerns certain matters.*
> *However, should anything happen to disrupt our plans... let's just say that neither of us wants to find out what consequences await.*
> *So please, keep yourself safe and sound until we meet again. Your loyalty shall not go unrewarded.*
> *Yours truly,*
> *Lilith's Friend*
