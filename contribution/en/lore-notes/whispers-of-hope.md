Today I met Jehanna Phillips again... She is so amazing! Her voice is like angels singing and her smile could light up the whole room. Every time we meet, my heart skips a beat. I don't know why she likes me though, I'm just a simple bartender working at the Red Bar. Maybe it's because I listen to her stories about her adventures across the city while serving her drinks. Or maybe it's something else entirely. All I know is that every moment spent with her feels magical.

If only she knew how much I truly admire her courage and strength. How much I wish to stand beside her as equals instead of being stuck behind this counter forever. But alas, dreams often remain just that â€“ dreams. Still, seeing her walk away tonight left me feeling both happy and sad at once. Happy because our brief encounter brought joy into my otherwise dreary existence, but sad knowing that our paths may never cross again except in passing moments like these.

Oh well, at least I have my memories now... Memories which keep me going during these lonely nights when all seems lost. Until next time, dear Jehanna... May luck shine upon us both once more.

Yours sincerely,
Chloe
