*You notice a old voice recorder lying on the ground.*

>Hey everyone! It's Dr. Lily Chen again. I just finished another experiment today and boy oh boy, did it go wrong...again. But hey, that's why we call it research right? To learn from our mistakes. So anyway, let me tell ya about my latest fiasco.

I was trying to create a new type of memory chip that could hold infinite amounts of data. Sounds cool, right? Well, turns out, it wasn't so cool after all. During the process, something went haywire and now every time someone tries to access the information stored in these chips, they start hearing voices in their head. Not just any voices either â€“ nope, these ones belong to dead celebrities giving advice on everything from cooking tips to tax evasion strategies. Talk about unexpected results!

Anyway, I guess my point is that sometimes even when things seem hopeless or impossible, there's still room for discovery and maybe even success (or at least less failure). Keep pushing boundaries folks! Oh, and please don't try using these memory chips until further notice. Let's give science some time to figure out what exactly happened here before anyone gets arrested for tax fraud by Marilyn Monroe's ghostly guidance. Bye for now!
