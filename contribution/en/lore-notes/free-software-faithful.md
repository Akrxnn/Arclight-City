>*Religious Texts and Cult Scriptures (Excerpts)*

In the year 2056, a man named Richard Stallman founded the Church of Emacs. He believed that using the text editor Emacs would bring about enlightenment and salvation. His teachings spread quickly throughout the hacker community, attracting both programmers and non-programmers alike.

The Church of Emacs grew rapidly, establishing chapters across the globe. Their main gathering places were hackerspaces, where members could come together to worship and learn from each other. Services typically involved meditating while editing code, followed by discussions about the spiritual significance of programming languages and tools.

Despite its rapid growth, the Church of Emacs faced criticism from traditional religions and skeptics who dismissed their beliefs as mere superstition. However, the church persisted, maintaining that their faith was rooted in logic and reason rather than blind faith alone.

Today, the Church of Emacs remains active, continuing to preach the gospel of free software and open source culture. While they may never achieve widespread acceptance among mainstream religions, they continue to thrive within their own niche community, offering solace and fellowship to those who share their unique belief system.
