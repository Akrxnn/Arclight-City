> You were going through the desk of a dead gang member when you stumbled upon an old letter tucked away in a drawer. It looked like it had been written years ago, its edges frayed and yellowed with age. Curiosity getting the best of you, you pulled it out and began reading.
> Dearest Chloe,
> I can hardly believe it's been two weeks since we last saw each other. Time seems to fly when we're together, doesn't it? But alas, our circumstances keep us apart. My heart aches every moment we're apart, longing for your warm embrace and soft touch.
> Life in this city is hard enough without having to face it alone. Your presence makes everything seem just a bit brighter, a bit more bearable. Knowing that there's someone out there who loves me, despite my flaws and imperfections... well, it gives me strength when times grow tough.
> There's something about you that draws me in, Chloe â€“ something beyond your beauty or charm. Maybe it's the sparkle in your eye whenever you laugh, or the way your smile lights up an entire room. Whatever it is, I am forever grateful for having crossed paths with you.
> Until we meet again, know that my thoughts are constantly with you. Take care of yourself, my love, and remember that no matter how far apart we may be, my heart will always find its way back to yours.
> Yours truly,
> Liam
