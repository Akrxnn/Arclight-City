> You stumbled upon an old terminal hidden behind a stack of crates in the corner of the room. As you approached it, you could see that someone had left a message scrawled across its screen. It read:
> *In the year of our Lord 2097, great calamities shall befall us. The sky shall turn crimson with fire and brimstone, and the earth shall shake violently beneath our feet. Only those who heed my words shall survive.*
