> I can't believe I am doing this... But I gotta let someone know what happened. I met this guy named Jack last week at the Red Bar, he seemed nice enough, we had few drinks and then he offered me a job. He told me about this big score he heard about from his source inside CircuitBreak, all we needed to do was break into their main server room and steal some data. Sounded easy enough right? Wrong!

> We managed to get past the security systems, but once we were inside, shit hit the fan. Turns out, the data wasn't just some random info, it was something important related to their next target. Before we could escape, we were ambushed by a team of mercs led by none other than our beloved Chloe herself!

> Long story short, Jack sold us out to protect himself, and now I am sitting here waiting for my turn to face the music. If you ever see him around, please give him a message from me: "Thanks for nothing, buddy!"
