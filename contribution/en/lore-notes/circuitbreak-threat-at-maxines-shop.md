> You were raiding an abandoned warehouse belonging to a rival gang when you stumbled upon an old computer terminal hidden behind a stack of crates. As you approached it cautiously, hoping for some valuable information about their operations, you couldn't help but notice the strange symbols etched onto its surface. It looked like someone had tried to scratch them off but failed miserably.
> With a quick glance around the room to ensure that you weren't being watched, you inserted a data chip into the slot on the front panel of the terminal and waited patiently for it to boot up. After several seconds of whirring sounds and flashing lights, the screen flickered into life revealing a message from "Chloe".
> *Note from Chloe:*
> Hey Choomba! I hope this finds you well. Listen, I got wind of something big going down tomorrow night at Maxine's shop. Apparently, some heavy hitters from CircuitBreak are planning to pay her a visit looking for some serious firepower. Now, while I don't condone violence or anything like that, word on the street is that these guys mean business. So, take this info however you want but remember, knowledge is power my friend.*
> Love & Lights,
> Chloe
