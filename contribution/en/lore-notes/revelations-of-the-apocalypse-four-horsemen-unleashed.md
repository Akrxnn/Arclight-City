>*Religious Texts and Cult Scriptures (Excerpts)*
>In the year of our Lord 2096, the Prophet Ezekiel had a vision of the end times. He saw four horsemen ride forth from the gates of heaven, each bearing a symbol of destruction. The first horseman carried a sickle, representing famine. The second horseman rode upon a red horse, signifying war. The third horseman held scales in his hand, embodying plague and disease. And finally, the fourth horseman arrived astride a pale green steed, bringing with him death itself.
>As these harbingers of doom spread across the earth, the faithful were instructed to seek refuge in the mountains. There, they would await the arrival of the fifth horseman â€“ one who bore good tidings of salvation. It is believed that this savior figure will lead the remaining survivors to a new era of peace and prosperity. Until then, the believers must remain vigilant against the forces of chaos and darkness that threaten to consume us all.
