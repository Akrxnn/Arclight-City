>*Chloe's Note*
>Hey Choombas!
>Just wanna say thanks for coming by the Red Bar tonight. It's been pretty slow these days since we moved locations, but seeing familiar faces really brightened my day. I heard about what happened to Johnny last week... *shudders*. Stay safe out there alright?
>If anyone needs help finding something or getting connected with someone, feel free to ask me. I might just know a guy (or two) who can hook ya up. And hey, maybe next time we could play some pool instead of everyone staring at their phones all night long.
>Take care,
>Chloe
