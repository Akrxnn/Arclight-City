> You were going through the personal belongings of a dead gang member when you stumbled upon an old, crumpled piece of paper hidden away in a secret compartment of their jacket. Unfolding it carefully, you saw that it was a handwritten letter addressed to someone named "Chloe". Your curiosity piqued, you began reading...

> Dearest Chloe,
>
> I can't help but feel drawn to you every time I see you behind that counter, pouring drinks for those roughnecks. There's something about the way you move, the way you never let anyone see past that cold exterior... It intrigues me.
>
> I may not be able to show my true feelings right now, but please know that I am watching over you, waiting for the perfect moment to reveal myself. Until then, take care of yourself and keep running that mean streak of yours.
>
> Yours truly,
>
