*August 19th, 2086*

Today was another long day in the field. We managed to take down a rival gang hideout, but not without casualties. I can still hear the echoes of gunfire and screams in my head. It seems like every job gets harder these days. Maybe it's time for a break...

On a brighter note, I met someone interesting today. Her name is Chloe, she works at the Red Bar. She may just be what I need right now â€“ someone who understands this life we live. We exchanged numbers and promised each other a drink after our next job.

As for tomorrow, more of the same. Another mission, another paycheck. At least with Maxine's help, I know my gear won't let me down. But something tells me it'll be another close call...

Signed,
Lilith
