>*Chloe's Manifesto*
----
As we stand today, the world is divided into two classes: the haves and the have-nots. Those who live in luxury while others struggle just to survive. But I say enough! It's time for a change. We must rise up against our oppressors and demand equality for all. Only then can we truly call ourselves free. Join me in this fight for justice and let us create a society where everyone has access to the same opportunities regardless of their social status. Together, we shall build a brighter future for generations to come.
