*You notice a old terminal on the wall, and decide to have a look.*
>*On the screen appears a video file named 'Lost Footage'. You open it.*
>*The video starts showing a chaotic scene, a gang warfare taking place in an alleyway. Bullets flying everywhere, bodies lying on the ground. Suddenly, a figure dressed in heavy armor and wielding dual pistols appears from nowhere, mowing down enemies left and right. It seems like he's trying to rescue someone.*
>*As the camera zooms in, you see a woman being held at gunpoint by two large men. She looks terrified. The mysterious figure charges towards them, guns blazing. There's a brief exchange of fire before the large men fall dead around him. He approaches the woman carefully, offering her his hand.*
>*She takes it gratefully and they both run away from the scene just as another group of gang members enter the alleyway.*
>*The video ends abruptly, leaving you wondering about the identity of these heroes...*
