> You stumbled upon an old terminal hidden behind a stack of crates in the abandoned warehouse. It looked like someone had tried to destroy it, but luckily, it still worked. As you started poking around, you realized that it contained information about a smuggler's operation. Here's what you found:
---
> **Smuggler's Name:** Jackie Chan
> **Contact Info:** None available
> **Illegal Goods:** Neuroblockers, Counterfeit Euros, High-End Cyberwear, Illicit Software
> **Routes:** From Asia to Europe via Africa, Middle East, and South America
> **Notes:** Be careful dealing with Jackie, he's got a reputation for being trigger happy and unpredictable. Also, watch out for rival gangs trying to steal his shipments. If you can manage to establish contact with him, let him know we heard good things about his product quality.
