*You notice a crumpled piece of paper lying on the ground near the door.*

Picking it up, you see that it contains a hastily scribbled message:

To my dearest Chloe,

I can't help but feel drawn to you every time I step foot into the Red Bar. Your cold demeanor may fool others, but not me. I see the fire burning inside you, just waiting to be set free. You are truly one of a kind, and I wish nothing more than to share a drink with you sometime...if only to hear the sound of your voice again.

Until then, stay safe and keep shining bright like the star you are.

Your Secret Admirer
