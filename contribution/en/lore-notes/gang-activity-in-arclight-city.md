>*Gang Profile: The Reapers*
The Reapers are one of the oldest and largest gangs in Arclight City. Their territory spans across several districts including Downtown, Old Town, and parts of the Pharmadome District. Led by a mysterious figure known only as 'Boss', they engage primarily in drug trafficking, extortion, and protection rackets. Recently, there have been rumors suggesting that they may expand their operations into cybercrime as well.

>*Gang Profile: The Lost Boys*
Formed from disgruntled ex-members of The Reapers, The Lost Boys control smaller pockets of territory mainly around the Geto Slums area. Unlike their predecessor gang, they rely heavily on violence and intimidation tactics rather than subtlety when dealing with rivals or civilians alike. Their leader, 'Preacher', is known for his extreme religious views which he tries to impose upon members whenever possible.

>*Conclusion:*
It is clear that both gangs pose significant threats to law abiding citizens living within their respective areas of operation. Collaborative efforts must be made between local authorities and community leaders to address these issues head-on before they escalate further endangering lives and property within Arclight City.
