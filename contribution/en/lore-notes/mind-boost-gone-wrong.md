Today marks another successful day in our experimentation with neural implants designed to enhance cognitive abilities beyond normal human limits. Our test subject, code named 'Adam', has shown remarkable progress since we began the procedure two weeks ago. His IQ score has increased by nearly 50 points, and he displays signs of enhanced memory retention and problem-solving skills.

However, during today's tests, Adam experienced a sudden surge of anger which resulted in him lashing out violently against the lab equipment. We were forced to sedate him before he could cause serious damage. Upon examination, we discovered that the neural implant had malfunctioned due to an unknown error in programming.

This incident highlights the potential risks associated with these types of augmentations. While the benefits may be significant, there is always the risk of unforeseen consequences. It is imperative that we continue to monitor Adam closely and investigate the root cause of this malfunction. Only then can we ensure the safety of future subjects and refine our techniques for optimal results.
