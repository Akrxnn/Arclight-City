>*Dr. Katherine Chen's Voice Recording*
----
Hey everyone! It's Dr. Katherine Chen again. I just finished another day of experiments in my lab and boy oh boy do I have exciting news for you guys! So today we were trying to create a new type of memory chip that could hold infinite amounts of data without losing its integrity. And guess what? We succeeded! Well... kind of. You see, when we tested it out on our little rat buddy here, he started having these really vivid dreams about being a ninja turtle and saving the world from aliens. Like seriously trippy stuff. But hey, maybe that's just what happens when you give rodents access to limitless knowledge. Anyway, stay tuned for further updates on our progress! Over and out.
