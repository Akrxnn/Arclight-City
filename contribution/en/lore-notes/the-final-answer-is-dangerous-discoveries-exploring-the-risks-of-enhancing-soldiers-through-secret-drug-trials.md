> Purpose: To record my findings about the effects of certain drugs on individuals with extensive cyberware implants.
> Backstory: I am a researcher working for CircuitBreak Security Corporation. My team and I were tasked with finding ways to enhance our assassin's abilities using various methods including pharmaceuticals. We managed to acquire samples of experimental drugs developed by TaiXing Cybernetic which promised significant boosts in reaction times and pain tolerance among others. However, due to strict regulations governing these substances, we had to conduct our tests discreetly within an abandoned warehouse converted into a makeshift lab deep within enemy territory.
> Situation: After months of careful experimentation on myself and several volunteers (all highly skilled mercenaries), I can confirm that the results are nothing short of remarkable. Our subjects exhibited increased reflexes, heightened sensory perception, and an almost complete lack of pain response during intense combat situations. Furthermore, they reported experiencing euphoric states similar to those induced by recreational drugs while under the influence of these compounds.
> Motivation: While these findings could potentially revolutionize the field of cybernetic enhancements, they also raise serious ethical concerns regarding the manipulation of human consciousness for military purposes. As someone who values both scientific progress and personal freedom above all else, I feel compelled to share my observations with the wider community before they fall into the wrong hands.
