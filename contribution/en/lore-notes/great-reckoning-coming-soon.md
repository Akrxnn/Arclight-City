> You stumbled upon an old terminal hidden behind a pile of rubble in the abandoned basement of the gang stronghold. As you approached it, you could see that someone had left a message scrawled across its screen. It read:
> *Apocalyptic Prophecy from the Whisperer*
>
> "Beware my children, for the end times draw near. The stars align and portents abound, signaling chaos and destruction beyond measure. Mark my words well, for soon shall come the great reckoning. Only those prepared shall survive."
>
