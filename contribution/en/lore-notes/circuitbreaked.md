>*Maxine's Weapon Smith Store*

As I sit here typing this message, my heart races with fear. It feels like someone is watching me, but when I turn around, nobody's there. *CircuitBreak*, the biggest security firm in Arclight City, just sent me a threatening email demanding access to our inventory database. They claim they want to ensure we aren't dealing with terrorists or criminals, but I can't shake the feeling that something else is going on...

My gut tells me they're planning something sinister â€“ maybe even trying to shut us down altogether! But why would they target us? We've never done anything wrong before... Or have we?

I wish I could confide in someone about this, but everyone at work seems suspicious these days. Maybe it's time for me to start looking for another job... One far away from here.

Until then, I guess I'll keep my head down and try not to attract any unwanted attention. Wish me luck, chooms.
