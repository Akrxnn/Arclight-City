> You were rummaging through the desk of a dead gang member when you stumbled upon an old, yellowed envelope addressed to someone named 'Max'. Your curiosity piqued, you carefully opened the envelope and pulled out the letter inside. As you began reading the faded words, you felt yourself drawn into a tragic tale of love and loss...

> Dearest Max,
>
> I don't know if this letter will ever reach you or if you still remember me after all these years. But I had to try, just once more. Our time together was far too brief, yet every moment spent with you feels etched into my heart forever.
>
> The night we met, beneath the neon lights of the Red Bar, seemed like fate itself brought us together. Your smile lit up the room, and your laughter echoed in my soul. We danced until dawn, lost in each other's arms, oblivious to everything else around us.
>
> And then came the day when our paths diverged. You left to join that damned mercenary crew, chasing after dreams of glory and riches while leaving behind the woman who loved you. My heart broke into a million pieces as I watched you walk away without so much as a glance back.
>
> Years have passed since then, and I've tried to forget you. To move on with my life. But every time I close my eyes, I see your face, hear your voice calling out to me. It's torture, knowing that we could have been something truly special if only circumstances hadn't conspired against us.
>
> If you receive this letter, please know that I hold onto hope, however faint, that maybe someday we can find each other again. That we can pick up where we left off and finish what we started. Until then, take care of yourself, my dearest Max.
>
> Yours forever,
>
> Emily
